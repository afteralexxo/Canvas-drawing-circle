#Draw circles using javascript 
Drawing circles on the canvas  using Javascript and animate and control the circles
I use ES6 programming to animate/redraw the circles

The code is doing:
 - create 800 circles using for loop
 - change the circles axis with the constructor function
 - vast their radius
 - and call the animate function to do all things all time
